# SAVOR: Waste Less, Taste More

# About The Model
The SAVOR model is designed to help individuals and organizations reduce food waste by predicting optimal usage and storage times for various food items. By leveraging machine learning, the model analyzes data from various sources to provide recommendations that maximize the freshness and usability of food, thereby minimizing waste. The model can be applied in household settings, restaurants, and food supply chains to enhance sustainability efforts.
